Built a production-ready microservices ecosystem that handles real-world e-commerce complexity with 6 interconnected services working seamlessly together.
🏗️ Key Features:
 ✅ Microservices Architecture - 6 loosely coupled services
 ✅ Event-Driven Communication - Asynchronous Queue processing with RabbitMQ
 ✅ Multi-layer Redis Caching - Product ,Session & order caching
 ✅ Real-time Inventory Management - Stock reservation system
 ✅ Secure Payment Processing - Transaction handling with rollbacks using Stripe Gateway
 ✅ Smart Product Search - Elasticsearch integration
 ✅ Service Discovery - Dynamic service registration
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Backend: Spring Boot (Java) | Database: PostgreSQL
 Caching: Redis | Message Queue: RabbitMQ
 Search: Elasticsearch | Authentication: JWT
 Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway | Service Discovery: Eureka

🎓 Experience Gained:

✨System Design - Scalable microservices architecture
✨Event-Driven Patterns - Async messaging & loose coupling
✨Performance Optimization - Caching strategies & DB optimization
✨Distributed Systems - Service communication & data consistency


🎯 Why This Project:

This simulates real challenges faced by companies like Ecommerce platforms. It demonstrates my ability to design systems that scale, handle complex business logic across services, and implement industry-standard patterns beyond basic CRUD operations.
